# Sustainability of Long term demand for Lithium-Ion batteries

##  Purpose 

According to different scenarios set by the user, the algorithm determines if the world's lithium reserves known to date are sufficient to meet the demand (output<1) or not (output>1).

Assumptions:
- the world final consumption is entirely based on renewable energies 
- the only form of storage used is the Lithium-ion battery
- The calculations are based on current knowledge and technology 
- 
The Input "storage time [Hours]" allows to define the storage time of the different scenarios.
> 6 => 6 hours of average consumption stored

## Ecosystem

MATLAB 
trial version : (https://fr.mathworks.com/campaigns/products/trials.html?prodcode=ml)

## Usage

1. Assignment4.m and Convert_gkWhTOtTWh.m must be in the same file
2. Open Assignment4.m with MATLAB
3. Run it, the Input window will open
4. The default values are already entered, if no changes are desired, press the "ok" button
5. If a change is desired, In the field "storage time [Hours]" enter the different storage times required, separating them by a space, press the "ok" button

## Results 

For default settings, the maximum possible storage time is just over 6 hours.
